This repository contains the cache of the node_modules directory of the anaconda-webui repository.

There is no linear history here. The commits here are present only as tags, pointing to single commits, generated by a workflow running npm install on package.json from any pull request which changes it.

The tags are named sha-REF where REF is the 40-character hexadecimal identifier of the commit that the tag points to. A reference back to this identifier is stored as a gitlink for the node_modules directory in the anaconda-webui repository, and landed alongside the package.json changes in the pull request.

Additionally, each time anaconda-webui is released, there will be an additional tag which points to the node_modules which were used for that release. This tag will be the simple version number, equal to the version of the release.
